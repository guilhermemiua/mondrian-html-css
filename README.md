# Mondrian modern art created with HTML & CSS.

This is my first project using HTML & CSS, I was searching for something to create and train my skills, so I found the "Make your own Mondrian" project at https://googlecreativelab.github.io/coder-projects/projects/mondrian/ and I loved it. So I challenged myself to complete this project using only the measures and colors given by the site, without following step by step. I did it because I wanted to train the position concept in CSS, which I was learning. I'm really proud of this mini project and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did! :)
